    <p>Moo shu is a sweet and savory stir-fry typically made with pork and thinly sliced cabbage and vegetables. At the table, the mixture is then tucked into thin and chewy pancake wrappers. To make this at home (and make it weeknight-friendly), use storebought flour tortillas and pre-shredded coleslaw mix to save on time and prep work. </p>
